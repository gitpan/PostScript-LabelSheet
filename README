PostScript-LabelSheet

This module generates PostScript code to layout duplicate labels on a sheet of
paper. It can be used to print labels for jars of marmelade, or tickets for an
event. The design of a single label should be provided as an Encapsulated
PostScript file, and can be generated from an SVG design with the help of
Inkscape. Given the size of the sheet, the desired number of columns and rows,
the module calculates the scale and position of each label on the sheet. 

There is also a possibility to print numbered labels.
